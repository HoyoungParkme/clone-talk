## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth animations for chat bubbles and page transitions
clsx | Utility for conditional class names
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes

## Notes
- Backend is FastAPI (Python)
- Chat streaming uses POST /api/chat/stream (requires fetch + ReadableStream, not EventSource)
- Color palette: KakaoTalk inspired (Yellow #FEE500, Brown #3C1E1E, Blue-Gray #B2C7DA)
- Font: 'M PLUS Rounded 1c' for that friendly, soft chat app aesthetic
